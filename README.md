# Graph_Algorithms_with_Petgraph 
# Let's create a complete example that builds a directed graph, performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from a specified node, and finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## In This code we are doing the following things:
# 1. We create a directed graph representing connections between nodes labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
# 2. We add directed edges between nodes to define the connections in the graph.
# 3. We perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from node A and print the nodes visited during traversal.
# 4. We find the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm and print the shortest paths.


# you'll need to create a new Rust project and add petgraph as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

## NOTE :
# Implemented algorithms in rust to traverse the graph, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or  you can use Breadth-First Search (BFS)
